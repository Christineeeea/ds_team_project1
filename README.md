## Description:
In this project we will be determining the most profitable cities for Data Scientists to live in respect to base salary of those cities against the rent + cost of Living.


## Research Questions:
* Which 10 cities in the US currently have the highest average salary for Data Scientists?
* Which 10 cities have the highest ‘net living’ for a single Data Scientist?
    * Of the top 3 cities, what are the ‘quality of life’ factors?
    * Of the top 3 cities, how do the cost of living components compare to the designated benchmark?
* Which 10 cities have the highest ‘net living’ for a Data Scientist with a family of four
    * Of the top 3 cities, what are the ‘quality of life’ factors?
    * Of the top 3 cities, how do the cost of living components compare to the designated benchmark?
