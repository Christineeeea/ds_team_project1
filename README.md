# Data Scientists on the Move

## Description:
In this project we will be determining the rough ROI, where the investment is choosing a career as a Data Scientist, against the Rent/Cost of Living. Based off of the top 10 cities for Data Scientists jobs, established by salary, we will be exploring the rent cost and determining which locations are more suitable for future data scientist to apply to.


## Research Questions:
* Which 10 cities in the US currently have the highest median salary for Data Scientists/Analysts?
    * Of the top 10 cities, what is the cost of living?
    * Of the top 10 cities, what is the crime rate?
    * Of the top 10 cities, what is the traffic?
        * What is the taxi fare and gas price?
    * Of the top 10 cities, what is the quality of life!?

* Bonus: What is the monthly projected salary vs project cost-of-living for a Data Scientist in the analyzed top 10 highest paying cities for the next year.
